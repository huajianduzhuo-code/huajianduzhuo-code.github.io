When I'm not training models or proving theorems, you might find me:

## 🎵 Playing the Dizi (Chinese Bamboo Flute)

I hold a **Level 10 certificate** from the China Nationalities Orchestra Society. There's something magical about making music with a piece of bamboo! The dizi has been my companion since childhood, and it's a wonderful way to stay connected to traditional Chinese music.

P.S.: My wife is a PhD candidate in our department, but she could also be identified as a professional piano player. She claims I do not have a good sense of rhythm but I never think so.

## 🎭 Enjoying Peking Opera

I am not good at performing it, but I'm a devoted listener. The artistry, the elaborate costumes, and the incredible vocal techniques impress me a lot. It's one of those art forms that grows on you the more you learn about it.

## 🎤 Performing Xiangsheng (Chinese Crosstalk)

Yes, I do stand-up comedy! Xiangsheng is a traditional Chinese comedic performance art, and I've been passionate about it for years. 

Making people laugh is seriously underrated as a life skill. It's a completely different kind of performance compared to academic presentations!

## 🏔️ Getting Outdoors

Hiking, cycling, rock climbing... basically anything that gets me away from screens and into nature. The Bay Area is perfect for this.

Some favorites:
- 🚴 Cycling around the Bay
- 🧗 Indoor & outdoor rock climbing
- 🥾 Weekend hikes in the East Bay hills

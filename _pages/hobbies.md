When I'm not training models or proving theorems, you might find me:

## 🎵 Playing the Dizi (Chinese Bamboo Flute)

I hold a **Level 10 certificate** from the China Nationalities Orchestra Society. There's something magical about making music with a piece of bamboo! The dizi has been my companion since childhood, and it's a wonderful way to stay connected to traditional Chinese music.

## 🎭 Enjoying Peking Opera

I am not good at performing it, but I'm a devoted listener. The artistry, the tradition, the elaborate costumes, and the incredible vocal techniques — Peking Opera never fails to captivate me. It's one of those art forms that grows on you the more you learn about it.

## 🎤 Performing Xiangsheng (Chinese Crosstalk)

Yes, I do stand-up comedy! Xiangsheng is a traditional Chinese comedic performance art, and I've been passionate about it for years. 

🏆 **1st Place, Maji Cup National Xiangsheng Competition**

Making people laugh is seriously underrated as a life skill. The timing, the wordplay, the audience interaction — it's a completely different kind of performance compared to academic presentations!

## 🏔️ Getting Outdoors

Hiking, cycling, rock climbing... basically anything that gets me away from screens and into nature. The Bay Area is perfect for this — from the hills of Berkeley to the trails of Yosemite, there's always a new adventure waiting.

Some favorites:
- 🚴 Cycling around the Bay
- 🧗 Indoor & outdoor rock climbing
- 🥾 Weekend hikes in the East Bay hills

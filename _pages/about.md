I am **Haoyu Liu (刘浩宇)**, a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of [Industrial Engineering and Operations Research (IEOR)](https://ieor.berkeley.edu/) at the [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/), where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Zeyu Zheng](https://zheng80.github.io/). Before coming to Berkeley, I worked as a full-time Quantitative Researcher at [Optiver](https://www.optiver.com/) in Shanghai (2022-2023). I received my Bachelor of Economics from the [Guanghua School of Management](https://www.gsm.pku.edu.cn/) and B.S. in Mathematics from the [School of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/) at [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/) in 2022.


## Research Interests

My research focuses on the intersection of **machine learning** and **operations research**, with particular interests in:

- **Generative AI**: Diffusion Models, Large Language Models, Controllable Generative AI
- **Stochastic Modeling & Simulation**: Simulation, Inference Efficiency
- **Economics**: Economic Theory, A/B Testing & Experiment Design
